# Sign Up Form

This project is a rather simple
account creation form page from
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

On the left side, there's a picture, with the Odin name
on top of it, slightly opaque.

On the right side are 3 sections.

First is a disclaimer.

Second is the actual form, consisting of 6 input
boxes. First and Last names, Email, Phone Number,
Password and Confirm Password.

Third has a "Create Account" button, and a "Log in" button.

UPDATE 8/17/24:

Form now has password length limitations and validation,
and confirm password now has validation.

Along with validations, the inputs for both Password and
Password Confirmation have messages that appear under them,
red if they are not valid, green if they are.

The inputs have a red border if they are invalid, but
the border goes away if valid.
